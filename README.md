# Claymore-Miner-Gui
GUI interface for Claymore's Ethereum/Zcash/Other miners with dual coin support if the miner supports it. Still in alpha stages; very basic in design but does what it is intended to do. I will work on interface and more options later. If you want to donate my Ethereum address is 0xc81f792CC0D4845CAfB7E077463E6fF3c574a508.

You can run this anywhere. When it asks for pathname make sure it is the pathname to the config.txt in the claymore miner folder. Should run on any relatively recent version of the miner.
