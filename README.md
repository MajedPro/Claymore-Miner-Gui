# Claymore-Miner-Gui
GUI interface for Claymore's Ethereum Dual miner. Still in alpha stages; very basic in design but does what it is intended to do. I will work on interface and more options later. If you want to donate my Ethereum address is 0x1E34FaA41a6DF86D2F4C31003ac980b45Ff50e3c.

You can run this anywhere. When it asks for pathname make sure it is the pathname to the config.txt in the claymore miner folder. Should run on any relatively recent version of the miner.
